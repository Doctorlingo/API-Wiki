Attached is a list of categories and sub-categories to be added. 

Many main medical categories have sub-specialties that were not included. Having the ability to combine main categories should eliminate the need for sub-specialties sub-categories for the most part (i.e. pediatric surgery would just be pediatrics and surgery).

**Note:** This list is written with proper specialty names. We will likely need to have each of these addressed as their synonymous patient friendly names (i.e. ENT instead of Otolaryngologist).
